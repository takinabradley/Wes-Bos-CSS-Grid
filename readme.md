## 03 CSS Grid Fundementals:

- `grid-template-columns` accepts multiple width values, and creates columns of those widths.
- `grid-tempalte-rows` accepts multiple height values, and creates rows of those heights.
- `gap` or `grid-gap` adds gaps between columns and rows (or in-between grid tracks).
- `auto` value automatically layouts columns between the ones you set.
- `repeat(times, value)` is a useful CSS function for grid layouts

## 04 CSS Grid Dev Tools

- Firefox dev tools are pretty great for Grid. Use the Layout tab!

- You'll always have one more track than you'll have columns/rows

- devtools displays explicit tracks, implicit tracks, grid edge, and gaps differently.
