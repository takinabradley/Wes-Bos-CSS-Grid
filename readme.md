## 03 CSS Grid Fundementals:

- `grid-template-columns` accepts multiple width values, and creates columns of those widths.
- `grid-tempalte-rows` accepts multiple height values, and creates rows of those heights.
- `gap` or `grid-gap` adds gaps between columns and rows (or in-between grid tracks).
- `auto` value automatically layouts columns between the ones you set.
- `repeat(times, value)` is a useful CSS function for grid layouts
